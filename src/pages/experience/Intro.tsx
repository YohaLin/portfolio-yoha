      <h3>A frontend engineer who transitioned from pharmacy.</h3>
      <p>
        Frontend development is like magical potion-making to me, transforming
        abstract ideas into concrete interfaces that users can interact with.
        Just as pharmaceutical formulations are crafted into therapeutic
        solutions, every line of code is a carefully configured ingredient, and
        every component is precisely measured to deliver the optimal user
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the precise calculations of pharmacy to the meticulous
        craftsmanship of frontend development, this journey is not just a career
        transition, but a cross-disciplinary exploration and challenge. I look
        forward to leveraging this unique background to build more intuitive and
        user-friendly bridges between technology and people.
